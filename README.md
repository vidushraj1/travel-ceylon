# Travel Ceylon - A Modern Tourist Guide to Sri Lanka

This project is a complete modernization of an original university group project. It transforms a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website into a fast, responsive, and modern web application built with React and Vite. The new version is optimized for performance and user experience, showcasing the best tourist destinations in Sri Lanka, and is deployed on GitHub Pages for global access.

## The Original Application: A Static HTML/CSS/JS Website

The initial project was a university coursework assignment designed to demonstrate fundamental web development skills. It functioned as a simple, static website to provide information about tourist spots in Sri Lanka.

**Original Repository:** [https://github.com/vidushraj1/web_coursework_group](https://github.com/vidushraj1/web_coursework_group)

### Original Functionality

*   **Static Pages:** The website consisted of several static HTML pages, each detailing different aspects of Sri Lankan tourism.
*   **Basic Styling:** Styling was handled with standard CSS to structure the content and provide a visual layout.
*   **Simple Interactivity:** JavaScript was used for minor dynamic elements and basic user interactions.
*   **Group Collaboration:** Developed as a collaborative effort to apply foundational web development principles.

### Original Technology Stack

*   **Markup:** HTML5
*   **Styling:** CSS3
*   **Scripting:** JavaScript

## The Modernization: A Fast and Dynamic React Application

The goal of the refactoring process was to address the limitations of the original static site (e.g., slow load times, difficult maintenance, outdated design) and re-engineer it as a professional, high-performance, and easily maintainable single-page application (SPA).

**Live Web Application:** [https://vidushraj1.github.io/travel-ceylon/](https://vidushraj1.github.io/travel-ceylon/)

### New Features & Improvements

*   **Modern User Experience:** The classic multi-page layout has been replaced with a seamless, responsive, and intuitive **React Single-Page Application**.
*   **Blazing-Fast Performance:** Rebuilt using **Vite**, a next-generation frontend tooling system that provides an extremely fast development server and optimized build process.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is now built with reusable React components, making the codebase cleaner, more scalable, and easier to manage.
*   **Enhanced Interactivity:** Modern JavaScript (ES6+) and React's state management capabilities allow for more complex and dynamic user interactions.
*   **Optimized Deployment:** The application is deployed as a static site on **GitHub Pages**, offering excellent performance, reliability, and free hosting.
*   **Improved Maintainability:** The new structure significantly simplifies the process of updating content and adding new features.

### Modern Technology Stack

*   **Core Framework:** React
*   **Build Tool:** Vite
*   **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Styling:** CSS3
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
